The Link To Site plugin allows you to create a link style post commonly seen in blogs like DaringFireball.net, Marco.org, MacStories.net and SixColors.com. This means that you can link from your blog home or from RSS directly to an external page and not to your post\\\'s permalink.

== Description ==
Blogging takes time and sometimes you just want to comment on a cool blog post, article or website that you found online without all the extra effort. The \"Link To Site\" plugin allows you to create a link style post quickly and easily, thus reducing the friction required to create quick posts.
